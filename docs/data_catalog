Overview
The Gold Layer represents the business-level data in your analytics architecture.
It is structured to support reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics by using dimension tables and fact tables.

Dimension tables store descriptive attributes (e.g., customers, products).

Fact tables store measurable business transactions (e.g., sales).
