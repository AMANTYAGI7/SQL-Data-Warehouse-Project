# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project

📌 Overview

This project delivers a multi-layered SQL Data Warehouse that takes data from raw ingestion all the way to business-ready insights.
Following the Bronze → Silver → Gold architecture, each stage progressively cleans, structures, and enriches data to make it analytics-ready.

1️⃣ Project Initialization

📂 Create Git repository & folder structure.
🗄 Create database & schemas.
📝 Define detailed project tasks & naming conventions.

2️⃣ Data Design & Architecture

💡 Brainstorm and design the data layers.
⚙ Choose a suitable data management approach.
🖊 Draw the end-to-end data architecture using Draw.io.

3️⃣ Bronze Layer – Raw Data Ingestion

🔍 Analyzing: Identify & understand source systems.
💻 Coding: Build ingestion pipelines.
✅ Validating: Data completeness & schema checks.
📦 Versioning: Commit ingestion scripts to Git.

4️⃣ Silver Layer – Cleansed & Standardized Data

🔍 Analyzing: Explore and understand ingested data.
💻 Coding: Apply cleansing & transformation logic.
✅ Validating: Data correctness checks.
🗂 Versioning: Document and commit to Git.
